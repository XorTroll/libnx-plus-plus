> Simple, efficient, headers-only C++17 libnx wrappers

libnx++ is a WIP library, header-only, for C++17 projects, providing a nice C++-ish wrapper for C libnx libraries.

An old project of mine, Biosphere, was an attempt to make C++-only Switch homebrew development libraries. Finally, taking into account how much dedication and time would be needed to keep them properly working and updated, I've decided to grab several Biosphere's implementations, classes and ideas and join them to make this nice wrappers.

As a sidenote, the layout and structure of the libraries is similar to the one found in the official Nintendo SDK (the main **nn** namespace can be compared to nx++'s **nx** namespace)
